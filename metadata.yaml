description: Best known today as author of The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table , the
  physician, poet, and lecturer Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. (1809-1894) was one of Mark
  Twain's favorite writers. This 1884 biography traces his early years and successful
  career in science and in writing. Brown is able to create a distinct narrative,
  as Holmes himself supplied her with fresh material and directed her in the making
  of the book.
